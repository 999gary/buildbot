Lutris buildbot
===============

This repository contains various build scripts for runners and games used by 
Lutris. The target system for these scripts is Debian Jessie (the same system 
used by the Lutris runtime).

It is advised to run these scripts from a LXC container.

The minimal system should have the following packages installed::

    build-essential sudo vim git
